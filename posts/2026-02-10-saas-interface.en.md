# SaaS Isn’t Dying. Its Interface Is.

Databricks just posted a $5.4B revenue run rate.

Quietly, they admitted something bigger: the user interface moat is gone.

## The invisible problem

For years, companies mistook user training for defensibility.

Entire careers were built around knowing where to click.

Language erases that advantage.

---

## The real consequence

When software is controlled by plain English, the product disappears.

What’s left is raw capability.

If your value lives in the interface, you’re exposed.

---

## AI as infrastructure

This isn’t “AI replacing SaaS.”

It’s AI flattening it.

Systems of record stay. Everything else becomes plumbing.

---

## Making it simple

**Old world:**  
Human → UI → Query → Answer

**New world:**  
Human → Question → Answer

No certification.  
No dashboard loyalty.  
No patience.

---

## Status shift

The calm operators are already redesigning workflows so humans decide and machines execute.

Everyone else is debating pricing tiers.

---

## A soft reflection

If customers no longer need to learn your software to get value…

What’s your real product?

*The quiet part is over.*
